FinTECHTalents Festival - Trade Ledger Code Challenge

See my solution to the Trade Ledger Code Challenge!

Very simple to use, just head to https://gustavozapata.me/work/tradeledger/ and click on "Analyse" to see a report of the data provided.

I built it using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AJAX and jQuery.

It's been good fun and quite a challenge to complete.

I cannot wait to see other programmer's solutions.

Looking forward to the FinTECHTalents Festival.
