FinTECHTalents Festival - Trade Ledger Code Challenge

See my solution to the Trade Ledger Code Challenge!

Very simple to use, just head to https://gustavozapata.me/university/trade_ledger/index.html and click on "Analyse" to see a report of the data provided.

It's been good fun and quite a challenge to complete it.

I cannot wait to see other programmer's solutions.

Looking forward to the FinTECHTalents Festival.
